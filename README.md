## How I worked on this project

- I worked with tasks on a ClickUp board: [Screenshot of tasks](https://lensdump.com/a/gikFa)
- I use Visual Studio Code as the IDE.
- I used jQuery UI and Bootstrap for some UI Designs: [jQuery UI website](https://jqueryui.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- I used alertifyjs for alerts: [alertifyjs website](https://alertifyjs.com/)

## Why I built the project this way

- I wanted to make a music player where the user can listen to any of their songs which is why I added the feature of uploading an audio file.
- I added frequency bars when a song is playing because it was cool to see in a music player in my opinion, and it is a good indicator that a song is playing.
- I used alertify's alert notifications for a nice custom design on the alerts.
- I used jQuery UI for the progress bars since they had functions for implementing them.
- I used Bootstrap because I like their designs on buttons and icons, and it also helped me on structuring the layout of the music player.
- I added a song loop feature for when the user wants to play their favorite song on repeat.
- Volume bar and mute button were implmented because it lets the user control their volumes. If a user wants to listen to multiple things, then they can use the volume bar in this music player to adjust accordingly.

## If I had more time I would change this

- Make a drag and drop for file uploads
- Allow the user to upload multiple songs to play more than one song
- Implement a next and previous button, so they can change songs
